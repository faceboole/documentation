## Why Gauge?

The communication breakdowns between Developers and Business Stakeholders is a common risk of software development.

[BDD](http://agilecoach.typepad.com/agile-coaching/2012/03/bdd-in-a-nutshell.html) tools allow business analysts to write down behavioral requirements in a way that will also be understood by developers and help bridge the gap. Certain features of Gauge make it stand unique amongst others.

* A rich markup based on [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
