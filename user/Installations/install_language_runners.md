# Language runners

The language runner determines the language you would use to write your tests. To install a language runner and then initialise the runner, use the following commands

| Language | Command |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `Java` | `gauge --install java` |
| `C#` | `gauge --install csharp` |
| `Ruby` | `gauge --install ruby` |

## Community contributed language runners

The Gauge community maintains some language runners as well. Here is a list of additional language runners that you can use in your project:
