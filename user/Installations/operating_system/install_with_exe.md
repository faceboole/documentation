# Using the exe
-----

[Download](http://getgauge.io/get-started) the exe based on your system configuration and run it. Click your way through till you're asked to select your language.

The Windows installer allows you to select the language plugin(s) as part of the the installation process. A language plugin is essentially the language(s) that you would use to write your tests in. Check the box(es) you want to install. You can select more than one language plugin to install.

The Windows installer installs Gauge to `%PROGRAMFILES%` by default. But you can select where you want to install Gauge and complete Gauge installation.
