## Navigation from step to Implementation

This plugin allows you to Go to Definition of a Step, in a manner similar to doing it in Java code.

Simply Select the Step, Right-Click and Choose "Open Declaration".

Or, just press <kbd>F3</kbd> once you move your cursor to the Step.

## Quick Fix for unimplemented steps

The Plugin displays a warning when there is a Step with no matching implementation. The plugin also brings up a Quick-Fix option to implement the Step.

This option takes the user to a dialog where one can choose a Type to implement the Step Method, or Create a new Type, and implement the step there.

The plugin allows user to execute Gauge Specs from within Eclipse. There are various ways to do this:

- Right-Click on a Spec file -> Run-As -> Gauge Specs : This will execute all scenarios in the selected spec file.
- Right-Click on "specs" folder -> Run-As -> Gauge Specs : This will execute all scenarios in all the spec files under that folder.
