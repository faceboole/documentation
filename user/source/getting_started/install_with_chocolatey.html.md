### Using Chocolatey

Chocolatey is a package manager, very similar to brew for Mac. This provides for a simple command line way to install Gauge, if you don't like to click through a user interface.

Install Gauge using Chocolatey with the following command

```
> choco install gauge

```

If you're upgrading to a newer version, then use the command:

```
> choco upgrade gauge

```
