## Install Gauge on Mac

There are 2 ways you can download an install Gauge.

* Using brew
* Offline installation

We recommend using brew because it's very simple. However, if you have limitations then you can use the offline installation instructions.

### Home Brew

The following command installs Gauge.

For this to work, you will need to install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you have brew installed then all you need to run is this command; it will download and install Gauge. This requires you to be connected to the Internet.

```
$ brew update
$ brew install gauge
```

If you already have a version of Gauge then the following command will update to the latest version of Gauge.

```
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade gauge
```

### Offline Installation

You can [download the Gauge installer](http://getgauge.io/get-started). This is a `pkg` file, so you can click your way through to finish installing Gauge.

Check the page on [installing language runners](install_language_runners.md) to install language runner plug-ins.
