# Language runners
The langauge runner determines the language you would use to write your tests. To install a langauge runner and then initialise the runner, use the following commands

| Language | Command | Test code |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `Java` | ``$ gauge --install java`` | [Test code](../test_code/java/java.md) |
| `C#` | ``$ gauge --install csharp`` | [Test code](../test_code/csharp/csharp.md) |
| `Ruby` | ``$ gauge --install ruby`` | [Test code](../test_code/ruby/ruby.md) |

## Community contributed language runners

The Gauge community maintains some language runners as well. Here is a list of additional language runners that you can use in your project:
