# Contexts
-----

**Contexts** or **Context steps** are steps defined in a spec before any scenario.

They allow you to specify a set of conditions that are necessary for executing scenarios in a spec. Context steps can be used to set up data before running scenarios. They can also perform a setup or tear down function.

* Any regular [step](steps.md) can be used as a context.
* Contexts are executed before every scenario in the spec.

```
Delete project
==============
These are context steps

* User is logged in as "mike"
* Navigate to the project page

Delete single project
---------------------
* Delete the "example" project
* Ensure "example" project has been deleted

Delete multiple projects
------------------------
* Delete all the projects in the list
* Ensure project list is empty
```

In the above example spec the context steps are **`User is logged in as Mike`** and **`Navigate to the project page`**, they are defined before any scenario.

These steps are executed before the execution of each scenario `Delete single project` and `Delete multiple projects`.

The spec execution flow would be:

1. Context steps execution
2. `Delete single project` scenario execution
3. Context steps execution
3. `Delete multiple projects` scenario execution
