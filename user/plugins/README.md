# Plugins

Plugins are an easy way to extend the features of gauge. There are various types of plugins that gauge currently supports.

## Language Plugins

Also known as **language runners**, these plugins enable the users to write the implemantation of specs in a language of their choice. For a list of available language runners, see how to [install language runners](../installations/install_language_runners.md).

Example: [HTML Report](html_report_plugin.md), [XML Report](xml_report_plugin.md)
