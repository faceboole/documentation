# Getting Started

This section will explain the steps needed to get Gauge working.

Gauge is a first class command line tool. This means that you can operate entirely from the command line. Or, if you prefer to use an IDE then Gauge also has excellent integration with multiple IDEs.

## Setting up

* [Setup Gauge on your machine](../installations/README.md).
* [Create a Gauge project](creating_a_gauge_project.md) - You can use the command line or [use an IDE](../ide_support/README.md).

## Add tests

* Add [specifications](../gauge_domain/specifications.md).
* Add [code implementation](../language_features/step_implementations.md) for the steps.
