# Welcome to Gauge

Gauge is a light weight cross-platform test automation tool. It provides the ability to author test cases in the business language.

Gauge champions the idea of **living/executable documentation**.

Some of its key features include:

* A rich markup based on [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Support for writing test code in multiple programming languages. Currently [supported languages]((test_code/README.md).
* A modular architecture with [plugin](plugins/README.md) support.
* Consistency across language implementations.

Read [**Why Gauge**](why_gauge.md) can be used and more about the [Gauge domain](gauge_domain.md).
