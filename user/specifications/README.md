# Specifications

**Specifications** (spec) are business layer test cases which can also act as your feature documentation. They are written in the business language. Typically a spec or specification describe a particular feature of the application under test.

* They are written in a **.spec** file. Gauge also supports **.md** file format.
* The Markup for a Specification file is based on [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.

## A simple Spec

## Specification Heading

A Spec must begins with a spec heading and a single specification can contain only one spec heading.

It is written in **`<H1>`** syntax of markdown. This can be in two forms:

```
Spec Heading
============
```

 or

```
# Spec Heading
```

* Every spec must contain one or more [scenarios](scenarios.md).
* Every spec can be marked with labels using [tags](tags.md).

## Scenarios

Each scenario represents a single flow in a particular specification.

Consider the above example, **successful search** and **unsuccessful search** are 2 scenarios for the **search specification**. In business language terms they represent the entire search feature in the app.

Learn more about the structure of a [Scenario](scenarios.md).

## Steps

Steps are the executable part of the specification. They have underlying implementations in the programming language for execution of the specs.

They are written inside a specification ([context steps](contexts.md)) or a scenario.

Example:

```
* Search for product "die hard"
* User "admin" must be logged in
```
