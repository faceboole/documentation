If you have gauge installed, running gauge in terminal gives you command usage and all the flags it supports.\nThe command-line interface works across platforms. On GNU/Linux and OSX, you can use any terminal. On Windows, you can use cmd or Powershell.\nCreating a project\nTo create or initialize a Gauge project use the gauge --init command. For details, see how to create a Gauge project.\nExample: Create a project\nJavaC#Ruby$ gauge --init java$ gauge --init csharp$ gauge --init ruby\nExecuting tests\nInside a Gauge project, you can execute your tests by invoking gauge with path to specifications. By convention, specifications are stored in the the ./specs/ sub-directory in the project root. The syntax is:\n$ gauge [options] &lt;path-to-specs&gt;\n\nThe gauge command-line utility allows multiple ways to specify the specifications to be executed. A valid path for executing tests can be path to directories that contain specifications or path to specification files or path to scenarios or a mix of any of these three methods.\nSpecify directories\nYou can specify a single directory in which specifications are stored. Gauge scans the directory and picks up valid specification files.\nFor example:\n$ gauge specs/\n\nYou can also specify multiple directories in which specifications are stored. Gauge scans all the directories for valid specification files and executes them in one run.\nFor example:\n$ gauge specs-dir1/ specs-dir2/ specs-dir3/\n\nSpecify specification files\nYou can specify path to a specification files. In that case, Gauge executes only the specification files provided.\nFor example, to execute a single specification file:\n$ gauge specs/spec1.spec\n\nOr, to execute multiple specification files:\n$ gauge specs/spec1.spec specs/spec2.spec specs/spec3.spec\n\nSpecify scenarios\nYou can also specify a specific scenario or a list of scenarios to execute. To execute scenarios, gauge takes path to a specification file, followed by a colon and a zero-indexed number of scenarios.\nFor example, to execute the second scenario of a specification file named spec1.spec, you would do:\n$ gauge specs/spec1.spec:1\n\nTo specify multiple scenarios, add multiple such arguments. For example, to execute the first and third scenarios of a specification file named spec1.spec, you would do:\n$ gauge specs/spec1.spec:0 specs/spec1.spec:2\n\nVerbose reporting\nBy default, gauge reports at the specification level when executing tests. You can enable verbose, step-level reporting by using the --verbose flag. For example:\n$ gauge --verbose specs/\n\nSuggested reading\n\nCommand line flags\nSpecifications\nScenarios\nTagged execution\nParallel execution\n\n"},"cli/flags.html":{"url":"cli/flags.html","title":"Command Line Flags","body":"Gauge command-line flags\nHere is a list of flags (options) that can be used with gauge.\n\n\n\nFlag\nDescription\nUsage\n\n\n\n\n--add-plugin\nAdds the specified non-language plugin to the current project.\ngauge --add-plugin xml-report\n\n\n--api-port\nSpecifies the api port to be used.\ngauge --daemonize --api-port 7777\n\n\n--validate\nCheck for validation and parse errors.\ngauge --validate specs\n\n\n--daemonize\nRun as a daemon.\ngauge --daemonize\n\n\n--dir\nSet the working directory for the current command, accepts a path relative to current directory.\ngauge --dir=PATH specs\n\n\n--env\nSpecifies the environment.

Developers can use the information to help them program only what is needed, making the code as lean as possible.

If the checks are verified periodically, the new change in requirement could result in a failure when the change is yet to be implemented in the system, or vice versa. Fixing a failing build would serve as a mark of the completion of the functionality.

So, if the first step in a scenario fails, the subsequent steps are skipped. While this works for a majority of use cases, there are times when you need to execute all steps in a scenario irrespective of whether the previous steps have failed or not.\nTo address that requirement, Gauge provides a way for language runners to mark steps as recoverable, depending on whether the step implementation asks for it explicitly. Each language runner uses different syntax, depending on the language idioms, to allow a step implementation to be marked to continue on failure.\nUsage\nJavaC#Ruby// The `@ContinueOnFailure` annotation tells Gauge to continue executing other\n// steps even if the current step fails.\n\npublic class StepImplementation {\n\n    @ContinueOnFailure\n    @Step(&quot;Say &lt;greeting&gt; to &lt;product name&gt;&quot;)\n    public void helloWorld(String greeting, String name) {\n        // If there is an error here, Gauge will still execute next steps\n    }\n}// The `[ContinueOnFailure]` attribute tells Gauge to continue executing other\n// steps even if the current step fails.\n\npublic class StepImplementation {\n\n    [ContinueOnFailure]\n    [Step(&quot;Say &lt;greeting&gt; to &lt;product name&gt;&quot;)]\n    public void HelloWorld(string greeting, string name) {\n        // If there is an error here, Gauge will still execute next steps\n    }\n}# The `:continue_on_failure =&gt; true` keyword argument tells Gauge to continue executing\n# other steps even if the current step fails.\n\nstep &apos;Say &lt;greeting&gt; to &lt;product_name&gt;&apos;, :continue_on_failure =&gt; true do |greeting, name|\n    # If there is an error here, Gauge will still execute next steps\nend\nCaveats\n\nContinue on failure does not apply to hooks. Hooks always fail on first error.\nStep implementations are still non-recoverable by default and Gauge does not execute subsequent steps upon failure. To make a step implementation continue on failure, it needs to be explicitly marked in the test code.\nThere is no way to globally mark a test run to treat all steps to continue on failure. Each step implementation has to be marked explicitly.\nIf an implementation uses step aliases, marking that implementation to continue on failure will also make all the aliases to continue on failure. So, if a step alias is supposed to break on failure and another step alias is supposed to continue on failure, they need to be extracted to two different step implementations.\n\n"},"troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html":{"url":"troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","body":"Troubleshooting\n\nLogs\nInstallation\nExecution\nIntellij IDE plugin\n\n"},"troubleshooting/logs.html":{"url":"troubleshooting/logs.html","title":"Logs","body":"Logs\n\nGauge logs are created under the logs directory in the project.\n2 log files are created\ngauge.log - logs for test execution\napi.log   - logs for gauge core api exposed for plugins\n\n\nTo customize logs directory set the logs_directory property in the env/default/default.properties file to a custom logs directory path.\n\nlogs_directory = my_logs_dir\n\nFor non-project specific actions like plugin installation log files are created in the following location.\n\n Windows - %APPDATA%\\gauge\\logs\n MacOS*  - &lt;user_home&gt;/.gauge/logs\n Linux   - &lt;user_home&gt;/.gauge/logs\n"},"troubleshooting/installation.html":{"url":"troubleshooting/installation.html","title":"Installation","body":"Troubleshooting\nGauge Installation\nWindows\n\nGAUGE_ROOT environment variable should be set to the gauge installation path.\n\nThe default installation location is %ProgramFiles%\\gauge.\n\ngauge_install_location\\bin should be in PATH to run from command line.\n\nGauge plugins are installed at %APPDATA%\\gauge\\plugins directory.\n\nAPPDATA directory is usually located at C:\\Users\\USER_NAME\\AppData\\Roaming.\n\n\nMac OS X\n\nThe default installation location is /usr/local/.\n\nOn custom installation location set the environment variable GAUGE_ROOT to custom_install_location.\n\nusr/local/bin/ should be in PATH.\n\nRun brew update before installing the latest version of gauge.\n\nIf installation is failing Upgrade homebrew\n\nGauge plugins are installed under ~/.gauge/plugins directory.\n\n\nLinux\n\nThe default installation location is /usr/local/.\n\nOn custom installation location Set the environment variable GAUGE_ROOT to custom_install_location.\n\nusr/local/bin/ or custom_install_location/bin should be in PATH.\n\nGauge plugins are installed under ~/.gauge/plugins directory.\n\n\nPlugin installation\n\nIf plugin installation fails due to a network connection issue, you can manually download the plugin distributable zip and install it using the -f flag.\n\ngauge --install plugin_name -f path_to_zip_file\nExample:\ngauge --install html-report -f html-report-1.0.3-darwin.x86.zip\n\nFind the plugin zip files under Releases section of the plugin github repositories.
